Canister Id-based URLs, such as ​​https://7e6iv-biaaa-aaaaf-aaada-cai.ic0.app, are hard to read and memorize. This feature will allow users on the Internet Computer to create custom subdomains on ic0.app for their canisters that are more user-friendly (e.g.,<name>.ic0.app). This is a first step towards enabling arbitrary URLs.
