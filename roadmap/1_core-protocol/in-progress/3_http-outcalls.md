This feature enables canisters (dapps/smart contracts) on the Internet Computer to make HTTP(S) outcalls to Web 2.0 services outside the blockchain in a trustless manner. It will cover a set subset of the typical oracle service functionalities and enable a plurality of new use cases, including directly obtaining data from external servers for DeFi dapps and decentralized insurance services, or sending notifications to end users via traditional communications channels.
